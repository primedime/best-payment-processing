          </div>
          <div class="basic-quick-info">
            <p>“Merchant services” refers to services that enable businesses to accept a customer’s credit card as
              payment.<br>
              The merchant services provider, or MSP, is the entity that processes a customer’s transaction in
              accordance<br>
              with security protocols and requirements. Merchant services providers are also referred to as “credit
              card<br>
              processors,” or CCP for short. MSPs act as the middle-man between your business and your customer’s<br>
              bank account.</p>

            <li><b>Step 2: </b>The credit card is swiped through a processing terminal. That terminal recognizes the
              card and contacts the credit card company.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3: </b>The card is authorized</li>
            <li><b>Step 4: </b>The credit card company sends ther payment to the merchant's bank through a certified
              merchant services provider.</li>
            <li><b>Step 5: </b>The merchant's bank deposits the payment into the merhcant's bank account.</li>
            <li><b>Step 6: </b>At the end of the month, the statement is sent to the mercnat that details the
              interchange for all transactions that month - which is the fee set<br>
              by credit card comapanies for merchants to accept their cards.</li>

        <h4>Merchant Services Fees and Rates</h4>
        <p>Understanding the different fees and rates for merchant services providers can be difficult. Every MSP may
          have a different way of calculating fees or<br>
          rates, or have varying pricing structures for merchants.<br>
          With that in mind, there are several different types of fees and rates MSPs offer:
        </p>
        <h3>Interchange fees</h3>
        <p>
          Interchange fees are set by credit card companies like Visa, American Express, or Discover. In essence,
          interchange fees are fees the merchant pays to<br>
          credit card companies for the ability to accept their cards. These fees are usually structured as a
          percentage for processing, plus cents per each<br>
          transaction. Some transactions, such as ones with foreign currency, can result in higher interchange fees.</p>
        <h3>Assessment fees</h3>
        <p>
          These are fees that take a percentage of your monthly sales volume. These can be costly for businesses
          processing a larger volume of sales.</p>
        <h3>Terminal fees</h3>
        <p>
          These fees speak to the cost of leasing a physical credit card terminal. These fees do not apply to
          eCommerce
          or online stores. However, these leasing<br>fees make buying a physical terminal outright more
          cost-effective
          instead of leasing it.</p>
        <h3>A monthly or annual service charge</h3>
        <p>
          Not every MSP will charge this fee, but a monthly/annual service charge is a charge to use the MPS’
          services.</p>
        <h3>Payment gateway fees</h3>
        <p>
          Payment gateway fees apply only to online stores. These fees are the cost of the online Point of Sale, or
          POS<br>
          for your store. This online POS is yourvirtual payment terminal.</p>
        <h3>Monthly minimum fee</h3>
        <p>
          If your business doesn’t transact a minimum volume a year, you may be charged this monthly fee.</p>

        <h4>Is Your Business Considered High Risk?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="high-risk-description">
        The type of business you have is one of the main factors that determines what you’ll pay for credit card
        processing. Every business is categorized and<br>
        given a merchant category code (MCC). If you have a high-risk MCC, you’ll be charged higher fees than
        low-risk
        businesses. High-risk MCCs include<br>
        those that sell products with a high return rate, need a large amount of capital to get started, or part of
        an
        industry with high turnover.<br>
        Some examples of high-risk MCCs are:
      </div>
      <div class="high-risk-list">
        <ul>
          <li>Online gambling or casinos</li>

          <li>Magazine or other subscription-based businesses</li>
          <li>Online dating services</li>
          <li>Debt collection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could also be considered a high-risk business if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have a history of frequent chargebacks</li>
          <li>You're a first-time business owner</li>
          <li>You have bad credit history</li>
          <li>You do a high volume of business with international customers in areas with high risk of chargebacks -
            outside of teh EU, North America, Japan, China<br>
            Singapore, or Australia</li>
          <li>You are a multi-currency business</li>

        <h4>How to Find the Best Credit Card Processors</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="card-processors-description">
        <p>Credit card processing is not a one-size-fits-all situation, as every business is different. A
          brick-and-mortar retail store and online store have different<br>
          needs. However, there are some traits that you should look for while choosing a credit card processor for
          your business:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Experience serving your industry or profession.</li>
          <li>The ability to serve all of your needs in one. If you have both a storefront and online store, you
            should
            find an MSP that can process both in-store andonline transactions. Integrated payment technology allows
            for this kind of ease-of-use, so look for processors that use or offer it.</li>
          <li>PCI compliance. PCI compliance, or Payment Card Industry compliance, are security standards set by card
            associations like Visa, MasterCard, andDiscover. Merchants can be fined if they’re found to be violating
            these standards. There are varying levels of PCI compliance, but you should look for aprocessor with
            Level
            1 PCI compliance, as it’s the highest level that can be attained. Ideally, processors should also be able
            to help you stay PCIcompliant to avoid costly fines.</li>
          <li>Compare fees carefully. Because there are a few different pricing models, it can be difficult to
            compare
            like with like. An MSP that seems to offer greatvalue at first glance might actually cost more in the
            long
            run due to the pricing model.</li>
          <li>Attainable minimum monthly transaction amounts for the MSP that you can expect to meet. If you’re a
            small
            or new business, a processor with a lowmonthly minimum would be ideal.</li>
          <li>If an MSP charges transactional fees, low fees that don’t increase with sales volume is ideal for large
            businesses. Likewise, small businesses with a lowprocessing volume would want a processor with the
            lowest
            fees.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

        <div class="small-business-description-one">
          <p>
            It’s important, especially for small businesses, to accept credit cards if their customers use the for
            payment. With the advantages of integrated payment<br>
            technology, small businesses can choose from physical terminals for their countertops; mobile card
            swipers
            for their iPhone or Android mobile devices;<br>
            virtual terminals for invoicing and billing, or online stores with shopping carts.
        </div>
        <div class="small-business-description-two">
          Conventional, physical terminals are the most convenient solutions for in-person transactions. If you run
          an
          online store and the bulk of your<br>
          transactions happen online, a shopping cart and online payment gateway might be best. Or if your business
          is
          frequently on the go, you might find a<br>
          mobile swiper that integrates with an app might be the best fit.

        <div class="payment-gateways-description">
          <p>A payment gateway is like a virtual terminal for your online store or business. Much like a physical
            terminal, it works with the credit card processor to<br>
            authorize and facilitate your online sales. Payment gateways encrypt customer data and securely send it
            to
            the credit card processor, which in turn sends<br>
            a request for payment to the customer’s card association - Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or any other
            credit
            card. Once the transaction is approved, the<br>
            CCP sends it to the payment gateway, which then securely sends back to the merchant.</p>
