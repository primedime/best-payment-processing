<h4>What is Merchant Services?</h4>

<p class="merchant-description">
    Merchant services is a broad terms that refers to merchant processing services giving a business the capability to accept payment using a customer's credit card.<br> 
    The merchant services provider (MSP) is the one who actually makes the transaction happen while complying with security requirements. Merchant services providers are also<br> 
    referred to as credit card processors (CCP). MSPs act as the intermediary between your business and your customer’s credit or debit card account.
</p>


<div class="merchant-list">
<h5>This is how it works:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A customer will swipe their credit card or enter their credit card information to make a purchase from your store</li>
    <li>Your point of sale software sends the data to your chosen MSP</li>
    <li>The MSP contacts the customer’s credit card association to check that they have enough credit to pay for the purchase</li>
    <li>The card association checks with the customer’s bank, and then (hopefully) sends the MSP a reply approving the transaction</li>
    <li>The MSP completes the transaction and sends you a receipt for the customer</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Merchant Services Fees and Rates</h4>

<p class="merchant-description-fees">
    Understanding the fees and rates for merchant services providers can be difficult. It seems like every MSP uses a different pricing structure and has a<br>
    different way of calculating your fees, which makes it hard to compare one MSP to another.
</p>

<h4>Here are the main fees and rates to look out for:</h4>
    
<h5>Interchange fees</h5>

<p class="interchange-fees-description">
    These are the biggest fees you'll pay. They're usually a percentage of each transaction plus a flat fee, e.g., 2.5% + $0.10 per transaction. Unusual transactions like foreign currency transactions incur higher interchange fees.
</p>

<h5>Assessment fees</h5>

<p class="assessment-fees-description">
    These are generally a percentage of your estimated monthly sales volume, e.g., 0.1% of sales up to 1,000 sales, then 0.11% of the next 1,000 sales, etc.
</p>

<h5>Terminal fees</h5>

<p class="terminal-fees-description">
    These are the cost of leasing a physical payment terminal for your store, so it doesn’t apply to online stores. Terminal leasing fees can add up to thousands of dollars, so it’s usually best to buy a terminal outright to avoid this extra charge.
</p>

<h5>A monthly or annual service charge</h5>

<p class="annual-service-description">
    Not all MSPs charge this fee, but it’s important to know to look out for it.
</p>

<h5>Payment gateway fees</h5>

<p class="payment-gateway-description">
    These only apply to online retailers. They pay for the cost of your online point of sale (POS) software, which is your virtual payment terminal.
</p>

<h5>Monthly minimum fee</h5>

<p class="minimum-fee-description">
    You’ll have to pay a monthly minimum fee if you don't make a certain minimum amount of transactions each year.
</p>

<h5>Is Your Business Considered High Risk?</h5>

<p class="high-risk-description">
    One of the main issues that affect how much you’ll pay MSPs is your type of business. Every business is organized into a merchant category and given a<br>
    merchant category code (MCC). If you have a high-risk MCC, you’ll be charged higher fees than low-risk businesses. High-risk MCCs include those that<br>
    sell products with a high return rate, need a large amount of capital to get started, or are considered to be in a high turnover industry.
</p>

<h5>high-risk MCCs are:</h5>

<h5>How to Find the Best Credit Card Prepocessors</h5>

<p class="prepocessors-description">
    There isn’t one credit card processor that is the best for everyone, because every business is different. What’s best for a large retail store with many<br>
    branches isn’t necessarily best for a small Ecommerce business. However, here are some things to look for to help you find the best credit card<br>
    processors for your business:
</p>

<div class="prepocessors-list">
<ul>
    <li>A CPP that has experience serving your selector</li>
    <li>A CPP that can service all your needs in one- for example, if you have an online store and a brick and morter store, look for an MSP that can<br>
        process borth face-to-face and online transactions</li>
    <li>Hidden fees. Many companies practice ‘bait and switch’ where the price you see advertised doesn’t include all of the real costs.</li>
    <li>Compare fees carefully. Because there are a few different pricing models, it can be difficult to compare like with like. An MSP that seems to offer<br>
        great value at first glance might actually cost more in the long run due to the pricing model.</li>
    <li>Check the minimum monthly transaction amount and make sure that you expect to meet it.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to whether the rates go up or down according to your volume of sales. If you make a lot of transactions, you'll want a CCP that<br>
        lowers the fee as sales increase, but if you make just a few high-value sales per month, you'll want the lowest fees to apply to the lowest sales<br>
        volume.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Credit Card Processing for Small Businesses</h5>

<p class="credit-card-processing-description">
    Paying by credit card is the norm these days so adding credit card processing capabilities can be a real boost to your income. Small businesses can<br>
    choose online credit card processing, a conventional credit card reader, or a mobile credit card processor that integrates with a smartphone or tablet.
</p>

<p class="credit-card-processing-description2">
    Conventional card readers can be best if you make a lot of face-to-face sales. If most of your credit card transactions take place online, then an online<br>
    CCP and payment gateway will be the most useful. Sole traders and mobile businesses, like electricians or entertainers, might find that a mobile CCP that<br>
    works with their smartphone serves them best.
</p>

<h5>What is a Payment Gateway</h5>

<p class="payment-gateway-description">
    A payment gateway is like a virtual terminal for your online business. It works together with the credit card processor (also called a payment processor,<br>
    which can make it easy to confuse with payment gateways) to authorize online sales. Payment gateways securely encrypt customer data and send it to<br>
    the payment processor, which then transmits a request for payment to the customer’s credit card association. When the CCP gets approval for the<br>
    transaction, it sends it to the payment gateway which then sends it securely back to the merchant.
